        <h2>The Origins of Stamp Collecting</h2>
        <p>Stamp collecting, also known as philately, is the collection and study of postage stamps and other related philatelic materials. The hobby of stamp collecting began shortly after the introduction of the world's first postage stamp, the Penny Black, in 1840.</p>
        <p>The Penny Black was issued by the United Kingdom and quickly gained popularity among the public, who were excited by the convenience of this new way to send letters. Soon, people began collecting these stamps as a hobby, and the practice of philately was born.</p>

        <p>The rise of the postal system and the increasing availability of stamps from around the world fueled the growth of philately. Collectors began to specialize in certain countries, themes, or time periods, and the first stamp collecting clubs and societies were formed.</p>
